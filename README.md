## About Me

I've always been a problem-solver, and I believe that software development is the perfect outlet for my curiosity and creativity. I love the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces and working to find the best solution.

## Projects

If you came to my profile, you probably want to see some of my abilities. Well, most of what I have been doing is "sheltered" by my company policy. However, you can get a sense with the following projects:

1. FlaskBlog
    - Name says it all. It is a full feature blog web application developed in Flask.
2. MummySweeper
    - Minesweeper game that lacks frontend beauty because I completly overestimated tkinter and that side is on hold. On another note, the logic in the background is something I am proud of.
3. TaskGenie 
    (https://taskgenie.onrender.com/)
