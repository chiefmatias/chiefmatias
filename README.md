## About Me

I've always been a problem-solver, and I believe that software development is the perfect outlet for my curiosity and creativity. I love the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces and working to find the best solution.

```python
import datetime
import random

def get_greeting():
    current_hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour
    if 5 <= current_hour < 12:
        return "Good morning!"
    elif 12 <= current_hour < 18:
        return "Good afternoon!"
    else:
        return "Good evening!"
```
