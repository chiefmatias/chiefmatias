## About Me

I've always been a problem-solver, and I believe that software development is the perfect outlet for my curiosity and creativity. I love the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces and working to find the best solution.

Currently loooking for a job!

```python
def hire_chiefmatias() -> bool:
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = hire_chiefmatias()
    print(f"Hiring chiefmatias: {result}")
```
